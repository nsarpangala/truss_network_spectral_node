# Repository Description

## Overview

This repository contains code for simulating and analyzing mechanical networks, specifically focusing dynamics of joints in Fourier space. The primary objective is to compute the Laplacian matrices for different network configurations and analyze the responses of nodes under various conditions. 


## Features

- **Laplacian Matrix Computation**: Functions to compute the Laplacian matrix for the Truss network based method we developed and corresponsinding balls-and-springs models.
- **Network Configuration**: Tools to define and manipulate network configurations, including node positions and edge connections.
- **Impedance Analysis**: Analysis of node responses based on varying impedance values for different rods in the network as an example
- **Boundary Conditions**: Handling of fixed coordinates and boundary conditions in the network.

## Files

- codes are in src/ folder
- example jupyter notebooks are in notebooks folder


## Required python libraries

Basic ones like numpy, matplotlib
